## Introduction

Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in understanding the future trends and patterns of financial markets. In this project, we focus on the closing prices of coffee stocks and demonstrate how to use Facebook Prophet to build accurate and interpretable forecasts.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need the following:

1. Python environment with necessary dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`).
2. A dataset containing historical coffee stock closing prices.

## Project Structure

```
├── data/                   # Directory for storing the dataset
├── notebooks/              # Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and modeling
├── utils/                  # Utility scripts for data preprocessing and model evaluation
├── README.md               # This comprehensive README file
└── requirements.txt        # List of required Python packages
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:** Place your historical coffee stock closing price dataset in the `data/` directory.

2. **Exploration and Modeling:** Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory. These notebooks guide you through data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation using Facebook Prophet.

3. **Forecasting:** Run the notebooks to generate forecasts and visualize the results. The forecasted closing prices will be saved in the `results/` directory.

## Results

Our models will provide you with accurate forecasts for the closing prices of coffee stocks. We'll visualize the predictions, highlight trends, and assess the model's performance. By exploring the results, you'll gain valuable insights into how to apply time series forecasting techniques to financial datasets.
